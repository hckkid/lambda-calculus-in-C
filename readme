Datastorer

	Flag -> '0' means start of a list '1' means Currently storing data block size info '2' means 
			currently storing some data '3' means end of current list
	Data -> User decided .
	
Syntax For assembly language

	A list Storing a name 	== Variable
	/\ 						== lambda
	:= 						== Definition
	A list of Variables		== list
	.						== Simple dot used for abstraction
	()						== parenthesis used for application
	(						== LPAREN
	)						== RPAREN
	
Hereby let me give ISA specifications though in brief but the sole idea is here

I tried to have as minimal ISA as i could in this much time yet with little humanity too
So by stmt1 , stmt2 kind of statements assume it is going to be a single machine instruction .

Let us a program which operates sequentially , Without any if else

Ex. A program to add one node to Storage Memory after current location and then forward 
Storage memory pointer by 1 .

INST1s , stmt1 stmt2 | INST2s , | FLGS , | STRDT1 , STRDT2

=>	INST1s stmt1 , stmt2 | INST2s , | FLGS , | STRDT1 , DT1 STRDT2 

=>	INST1s stmt1 stmt2 , | INST2s , | FLGS , | STRDT1 DT1 , STRDT2 

Now Let us consider execution of a program with an if else . 

The 'C' kind of code (just to show blocks of code )

stmt1
if(exp1)
{
	stmt2
	stmt3
	if(exp2)
	{
		stmt4
		stmt5
	}
}
else
{
	stmt6
	stmt7
}


Sorry for this large example . But hope no one will shout about case handling atleast .
If you still think there is some where this will not work , then your warm welcome from me .

So let us see how it executes .
